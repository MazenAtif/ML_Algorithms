# Support Vector Machine (SVM) & K-Means Clustering Algorithms
This repository contains Python implementations of **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** and **K-Means** Clustering algorithms from scratch, without using machine learning libraries like scikit-learn. These implementations aim to deepen your understanding of supervised classification and unsupervised clustering techniques.

## üìå Algorithms Implemented

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- A supervised learning algorithm for classification tasks.
- Implements the Hard-Margin and/or Soft-Margin SVM (based on hinge loss).
- Optimized using Gradient Descent or a basic Quadratic Programming approach.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **K-Means Clustering**
- An unsupervised learning algorithm used for clustering unlabeled data.
- Implements iterative steps of Assignment and Update.
- Includes methods to visualize cluster formation over iterations.

## üöÄ **How to Use**

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Pandas
- Sklearn (for comparison with our version)

### Running the Code
- **Support Vector Machine**:
  ```python
  python SVM.py
  ```
(You can modify datasets, kernel types, or hyperparameters.)

- **K-Means Clustering**:
```python
  python K_means.py
  ``` 
python kmeans.py
(Feel free to change the number of clusters k and initialize different data.)

## üìä **Results**

### Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Trains on a sample binary-class dataset.
- Plots the decision boundary separating two classes.
- Shows support vectors clearly.

### K-Means Clustering
- Clusters a set of data points into k distinct groups.
- Visualizes the movement of cluster centroids over iterations.
